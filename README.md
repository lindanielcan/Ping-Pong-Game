# Ping Pong Game

This is a ping pong game simulator, it's made with pygame, it's less accurate with angles since pygame <br>
does not offer rectangle surface with degrees, the turtle library does provide angles in radians, but this <br>
project is to practice the use of pygame.

Some game features:

* Two player playing on each side, who ever gets the winning score, win.
* When game is over, press space key to start again.
* The ball will move faster every time the player scores.

In order to run the game:

* Execute main.py
